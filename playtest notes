confused by start as another way of saying beginning deck
does not say that you should reveal the beginning and end cards
"the C1, C2, and C3 are not explained"
players did not make a C3 character
players discarded the beginning and end card after one turn
due to confusion the players decided to make C3 the judge's name
there were blank cards
used to the one round system of Cards Against Humanity
Awkward stories due to phrasing having no connection
less memes
make a key at the bottom of the cards to indicate the characters
Rule sheets wording is vague
Players drew 2 start and 2 end
doesn't specify if the beginning or end cards are played face up or down
only a few cards in hand makes the game harder and less funny
Idea: literally a card with Trump's face on it
change C4T4's name
