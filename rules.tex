\section*{Materials}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Start Deck
	\item Middle Deck
	\item End Deck
\end{itemize}

\section*{Setup}

Shuffle the three decks separately and give each player 3 "Middle Cards." The player who goes first will be decided by some arbitrary and obscure factor, but for now just choose anyone, that player is the first judge.

The judge will select two random cards from the "Start" and "End" decks respectively. After the start and end of the story have been defined, normal play begins.

\subsection*{Normal Play}

Each player other than the judge will play down a "Middle" card from their hand. Once all of the players have placed cards the judge will select a card to be part of the story, all other "Middle" cards played that round will be discarded.

Once the judge has picked a winning "Middle" card, all of the players whose cards were not chosen will draw another "Middle" card from the deck. If the winning player of that round has 0 cards remaining then they are declared the winner. At the end of each game the winner must read out the story that was created.
